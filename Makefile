# -Wfloat-conversion is not in -Wall or -Wextra and catches what the
# sanitizer cannot: an *implicit* float-to-integer conversion, typically a
# double handed to an integer parameter, where no cast appears in the source
# at all and a grep for "(int32_t)" finds nothing. Ghoti.io Tang had exactly
# that - a float literal passed into a pool keyed by an unsigned integer, so
# 1.5 and 1.0 shared a key. The two instruments do not overlap: an explicit
# cast silences this warning and is caught at runtime by float-cast-overflow
# instead, and an implicit conversion of an in-range value is a wrong answer
# that no sanitizer reports. This library is clean under it today, so the
# flag costs nothing and fails the build the moment that stops being true.
# -Wstrict-aliasing=1 is a stronger level than the one -Wall turns on, and
# -fstrict-aliasing is what arms it. Both halves were measured here.
#
# No sanitizer reports a strict-aliasing violation. On a minimal pair gcc
# actually miscompiles - two stores through different pointer types, then a
# reload - ASan and UBSan built with this library's own flags ran the
# miscompiled answer at -O2 and -O3 and printed nothing, exit 0. So this
# compile-time check is the only instrument the suite has for the class, and
# the runtime gates are not a second opinion on it.
#
# -Wall's level 3 reported nothing here. Level 1 reported eleven type-punned
# stores in obj_load.c: `(void **)&obj->faces` and its siblings wrote a
# `void *` through an lvalue whose declared type was a struct pointer. The
# fix was to return the buffer and let the assignment convert it. Level 1 is
# the noisiest level and the library is clean under it, so it costs nothing
# and fails the build the moment that stops being true.
#
# -fstrict-aliasing is named explicitly because the warning is silent without
# it and gcc only enables it from -O2. Without this the check would be live in
# the release tree and *silently inert* in every other tree that CFLAGS
# reaches: the coverage tree, which appends its own -O0, `BUILD=debug`, and a
# sanitizer tree if it is ever pinned to -O1. Measured: the warning fires at
# `-O0 -fstrict-aliasing`, and not at `-O0` or at `-O1`, so an optimised tree
# is not automatically a checked one. Planting a violation was seen to fail
# all four trees CFLAGS reaches - release, asan, coverage and debug - and the
# last two are the -O0 ones, which is the evidence for that half.
#
# Building the debug tree needs one flag, because BRANCH becomes `-debug` and
# CUTIL_PC is derived from it, so pkg-config is asked for a
# ghoti.io-cutil-debug that only a whole-suite debug bootstrap installs.
# Override the name and a debug build runs against the ordinary release
# prefix:
#
#   make BUILD=debug CUTIL_PC=ghoti.io-cutil-$(MAJOR_VERSION) test
#
# 262 tests pass there at -O0.
#
# Naming the flag does turn the aliasing *assumption* on where gcc had it off,
# which is a real change and not only a warning: `gcc -Q --help=optimizers`
# reports -fstrict-aliasing disabled at -O0 and -O1 and enabled from -O2. On
# this library it buys the optimiser nothing - all 9 objects are
# instruction-identical with the flag and with -fno-strict-aliasing, at both
# -O0 and -O1. That zero is a real zero rather than a measurement that could
# not see: the same comparison at -O2 does report a difference in obj_load.o.
#
# Compare the *disassembly*, not the object file. Debug info records the
# command line, so the flag changes every object whether or not it changes
# any code. On these 9 objects at -O1, the three comparisons disagree:
#
#   whole-object md5 differ   9 of 9    <- the confound; means nothing
#   strip-debug md5 differ    0 of 9
#   objdump -d text differ    0 of 9    <- what the numbers above are
#
# So here this changes what is checked and not what is built. That is
# measured rather than given, and a library adding this flag runs the
# comparison on its own code instead of inheriting the result: the same
# measurement elsewhere in the suite found objects that do change at -O1.
#
# `-Wall` is not neutral here: it sets -Wstrict-aliasing to 3 on its own, and
# level 3 is silent on the plain type-punned dereference that level 1
# rejects. So a library at -O2 with `-Wall -Werror` and no level named has
# the aliasing *optimisation* armed and no warning behind it - which reads,
# from the flag list, exactly like a library that is covered.
#
# The level cannot be read off the flag list by eye. `gcc -Q --help=warnings`
# with the real flags is the direct read, and on gcc 14.2 the precedence is
# not "the last level named wins". Each row below was confirmed twice, by -Q
# and by compiling a planted `*(int *)f = 7` at -O2 and counting the
# diagnostic, with `=1` alone warning and `=0` alone silent as the controls:
#
#                                           -Q   warns on the plant
#   -Wall                                    3   no
#   -Wall -Wstrict-aliasing                  3   -     bare, no level
#   -Wall -Wstrict-aliasing=1                1   yes
#   -Wstrict-aliasing=1 -Wall                1   yes   order does not matter
#   -Wall -Wstrict-aliasing=1 ...=3          3   no    between two explicit
#                                                      levels, it does
#   -Wstrict-aliasing=1 -Wno-strict-aliasing 0   -
#
# An explicit level beats -Wall's implicit 3 from either side, so this line's
# ordering is not load-bearing. What does beat it is another explicit level
# later on the command line, and $(EXTRA_CFLAGS) is last: `make
# EXTRA_CFLAGS=-Wstrict-aliasing=3` disarms this with every flag still
# present. Measured here, all four trees - release, debug, ASan, and
# LIB_CFLAGS - report level 1.
#
# The fuzz tree does not read CFLAGS - it builds with clang on a command line
# of its own, at -O1 and with -w, so it reports nothing and is not a warning
# gate - and clang implements nothing for -Wstrict-aliasing in any case,
# accepting the option silently and reporting nothing where gcc reports one.

check-aliasing: ## Fail if the strict-aliasing warning is not actually armed
# CFLAGS names -fstrict-aliasing and -Wstrict-aliasing=1, and neither spelling
# tells you the level that results. -Wall sets the level to 3 on its own, an
# explicit level beats it from either side, and a later explicit level beats
# that - so the resolved level depends on the whole command line, and
# $(EXTRA_CFLAGS) sits at the end of it. `make EXTRA_CFLAGS=-Wstrict-aliasing=3`
# builds this library with the aliasing optimisation armed and the warning
# silent, every flag still present and every comment about them still true.
# The CFLAGS comment has the measured precedence table.
#
# So ask the compiler instead of the flag list: compile a violation with the
# real $(CFLAGS) and require the diagnostic. That reads the level the command
# line resolves to, which no review of the spelling can do. The design is the
# chron session's.
#
# The probe pins the level at exactly 1. Measured on it: level 1 reports it,
# and levels 0, 2 and 3 are all silent.
#
# ---- Do not simplify the probe. Its shape is what makes it discriminating.
#
# Diagnostics at -O2, counted across five violation shapes:
#
#                                                      L0  L1  L2  L3
#   cast of a pointer PARAMETER      <- this probe       0   1   0   0
#   struct-to-struct cast of a parameter                 0   1   0   0
#   a void * stored through a typed lvalue               0   1   1   0
#   *(int *)&local, *(long *)&s->member                  0   2   2   2
#   laundered through a `void * v = p` variable          0   0   0   0
#
# Written the obvious way, `*(int *)&local`, this gate would pass with the
# warning at level 3 and certify nothing - row four is reported at every
# level from 1 up. A later tidy-up that "simplifies" the probe therefore
# silently removes the only thing it measures. The chron session hit this as
# a live near-miss in their own control. Measured here rather than argued:
# with the probe rewritten as `*(int *)&l`, `make
# EXTRA_CFLAGS=-Wstrict-aliasing=3 check-aliasing` exits 0 - the one case the
# gate exists to catch, passing green.
#
# Two axes decide those rows, and they matter if this library ever moves off
# level 1. Isolated pairwise at -O2:
#
#                                              L0  L1  L2  L3
#   *(int *)&g          known object, direct    0   1   1   1
#   int * p = (int *)&g known object, via var   0   1   1   0
#   *(int *)d           PARAMETER, direct       0   1   0   0
#   int * p = (int *)d  parameter, via var      0   1   0   0   <- this probe
#
# Taking the address of an object the compiler can see is what level 2 needs;
# routing the cast through a separate pointer variable is what defeats level
# 3. It is not about storage class - a local is a known object too.
#
# So this probe certifies level 1 and **would be vacuous at level 2**: green,
# asserting nothing. A gate meant to certify "1 or 2, but not 3" needs the
# second row - a known object through a variable. The first row is no use as a
# probe at all, since it fires at every level from 1 up. Change the probe if
# the level ever changes, or the gate silently stops measuring. Axes isolated
# by the chron and image sessions, reproduced here.
#
# Two further limits bound what a green run may be said to mean.
# Level 3 is not blind in general - it catches row four - so this library's
# seven-of-nine sibling libraries sitting at 3 are not uninstrumented, they
# are blind to rows one to three. Row three is the shape obj_load.c actually
# had, eleven times. And nothing catches row five at any level, including 1:
# a clean run here is not evidence about punning laundered through a void *
# variable, which is the spelling real code reaches for most readily.
# Enumerated by the chron session, reproduced here.
#
# So a silent probe has three different causes and they want opposite fixes,
# which is why the failure branch *measures* the cause rather than naming the
# likeliest one. A gate whose diagnosis is one step off sends the next reader
# after something that is not wrong, and they will trust it because the gate
# was right to fire - chron's earlier version blamed a regression that had not
# happened, and this one's first version told a clang user their level was
# wrong when it was 1 and correct:
#
#   $(CC) reports no level at all   a compiler that accepts the option and
#                                   implements nothing. clang does this, so
#                                   under clang there is no instrument here -
#                                   and no sanitizer covers the class either.
#   $(CC) reports 0, 2 or 3         the level is wrong; the flags are present.
#                                   3 is also what -Wall implies, so it is an
#                                   override or a removal and this cannot say
#                                   which - it says so rather than guessing.
#   $(CC) reports 1                 the level is right and it still did not
#                                   fire, which nothing here explains. Suspect
#                                   the probe or the compiler, not CFLAGS.
#
# Reading the level needs its own guard: an empty answer is not a level. clang
# exits 1 and prints nothing, and a flag string gcc rejects produces the same
# empty output from a zero-length variable - so the exit status and a
# non-empty level are both checked before the number is believed. That trap
# is the chron session's, hit twice in one hour from opposite directions.
#
# The clean file is the control and it does two jobs. It must compile *and* be
# silent: if both files failed for an unrelated reason - a bad -I, a missing
# header - the probe's grep would find nothing, and a gate that only asked
# "no diagnostic on the clean one" would pass while measuring nothing.

# Sanitizer build (ASan + UBSan): separate build dir, run the test suite
####################################################################
# -fno-sanitize-recover: without it UBSan PRINTS a diagnostic and carries on,
# so the process still exits 0 and the suite reports clean over undefined
# behaviour it just described. A gate that cannot fail is not a gate.
#
# float-cast-overflow is named separately because GCC does NOT put it in the
# `undefined` group - and so `-fno-sanitize-recover=undefined` does not reach
# it either. Measured: a cast of 1e30 to int under `-fsanitize=undefined
# -fno-sanitize-recover=undefined` printed nothing and exited 0, and with this
# flag it reports. Converting a float that does not fit is undefined
# behaviour, this library does it wherever a numeric option lands in an
# integer field, and neither half of the gate was watching. The same reasoning
# does not extend to float-divide-by-zero, which IEEE defines.
UBSAN_CHECKS := undefined,float-cast-overflow
# The gate's own -O, pinned rather than inherited. ASAN_CFLAGS starts from
# $(CFLAGS), so without this the sanitizer tree silently tracks the release
# level - it is -O2 today because the release build is, and it would become
# -O3 the day that did, with nobody deciding it.
#
# The argument for inheriting is that strict-aliasing and signed-overflow
# assumptions are inert at -O0 and live at -O2, so a UB gate should run at the
# level that ships. That is true about the *optimiser* and says nothing about
# what the *sanitizer sees*, and the two weld into one sentence very easily.
# The text session made that argument, measured it, and withdrew it. Measured
# again here on this library's own ASAN_CFLAGS, one defect per program so
# that halting at the first finding cannot hide a later one:
#
#                          -O1         -O2
#   heap-use-after-free    caught      caught
#   heap-buffer-overflow   caught      caught
#   stack-buffer-overflow  caught      caught
#   use-after-scope        caught      caught
#   signed overflow        caught      caught
#   float-cast overflow    caught      caught
#   strict aliasing        NOT caught  NOT caught
#
# Nothing the sanitizer can see depends on the level, so inheriting never
# bought the coverage the argument implied. The last row is the one that
# decides it: aliasing is the hazard the argument names, and no sanitizer in
# this toolchain reports it at any level - check-aliasing exists because of
# that, and it rejected the planted violation here at compile time, which is
# where that class has to be caught.
#
# use-after-scope was tested because the optimiser can dissolve the scope it
# depends on; it did not differ. That row is the reason to have measured
# rather than copied text's table.
#
# What pinning buys, both specific to this library. FUZZ_SAN is -O1, so the
# gate and the fuzzers now share one codegen and a fuzz artifact reproduces
# under test-asan without a level change in between. And the gate stops
# moving silently when the release level moves.
#
# For a trace that needs reading, `make test-asan BUILD=debug
# CUTIL_PC=ghoti.io-cutil-0` gives -O0. Trace quality is NOT the argument
# here: text measured the reports identical frame for frame and did not claim
# it, and neither does this.

# What happens then is worth spelling out, because the obvious check says the
# tree is fine. The --coverage objects stay behind carrying undefined
# __gcov_* references, but the .so built alongside them was linked WITH
# --coverage, so it resolves them and `nm -D --undefined-only` reports it
# clean. Nothing looks wrong. The contamination is latent in the objects: a
# later plain `make` finds them newer than their sources, does not rebuild
# them, and the first time it has any reason to RELINK it produces a .so with
# three undefined gcov symbols. bootstrap.sh installs that, and every
# downstream library fails to link.
#
# That happened. It broke the shared prefix for the whole workspace and was
# found by a sibling project failing to link, not by anything here - measured
# afterwards: instrumented object 3 gcov refs, the .so beside it 0, the same
# .so after a relink 3.
#
# So this is no longer a rule to remember. The release tree is not touched at
# all, there is nothing to clean up afterwards, and the hand-rolled shortcut
# that caused it - wanting the .gcov files, which this target used to destroy
# on its way out - no longer needs taking.
#
# The .gcda counters are removed first rather than the objects: gcov merges
# profiles across runs, so a stale one from a previous source revision reports
# against lines that have moved. The objects themselves are make's business.
